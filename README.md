A Project to run through the "[10 Minute Tutorial](https://cucumber.io/docs/guides/10-minute-tutorial/?lang=java)" on
the Cucumber site. There is one main difference, in that tutorial, they use Maven, this project will use Gradle.

the "[Browser Automation](https://cucumber.io/docs/guides/browser-automation/?lang=java)"
Guide.
